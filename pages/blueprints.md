Each lab makes conscious or unconscious decisions about how the group will be organized. We have developed documents to help new investigators identify these opportunities to define the group's structure.

An example onboarding manual is provided on GitHub via the [lab-carpentry/blueprint-onboarding](https://github.com/lab-carpentry/blueprint-onboarding) repository. This document can be processed with sphinx to generate your own lab's onboarding manual.

Examples of labs using this document include:

* [The Brown Lab](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/index.html)
* [The Greene Lab](http://greenelab-onboarding.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [The Huff Lab](http://arfc.github.io/manual/)
* [The Turk Lab](https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/docs/)
