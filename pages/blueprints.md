Each lab makes conscious or unconscious decisions about how the group will be organized. We have developed documents to help new investigators identify these opportunities to define the group's structure. Template sections for an onboarding manual can be found on [ReadTheDocs](http://lab-carpentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This onboarding document is licensed as CC0, so you can feel free to use it with or without attribution for your own group. Some of the examples below are also licensed CC0.
