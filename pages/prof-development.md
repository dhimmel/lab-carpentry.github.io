All of the members of the Lab Carpentry steering committee are scientists who care about fostering environments that promote discoveries. We tend to have an open science perspective. If you'd like to have one of us lead a discussion on lab management practices, either contact someone directly or send an e-mail to anna.c.greene@gmail.com to be connected with someone able to lead a discussion.

In addition to topics related to lab management, we're also happy to talk about our science. Our research domains span astronomy, computer science, ecology, math, and systems biology.

We aim to broadly disseminate the content of talks that we give, and we'll post the source or powerpoint files here after they are delivered. Most of these will be licensed under a permissive license.
